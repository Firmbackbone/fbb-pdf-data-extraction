Intercompany transactions, profits and balances among group companies and other consolidated entities are eliminated, unless these results are realised through transactions with third parties. Unrealised losses on intercompany transactions are also eliminated, unless such a loss qualifies as an impairment. The accounting policies of group companies and other consolidated entities have been changed where necessary, in order to align them to the prevailing group accounting policies. The companies included in the consolidation are: - Momo Medical B.V. (100%) Disposal groups that are acquired solely held for disposal are not consolidated. These \"held for disposal\" companies are recognised as securities as part of current assets, if, on the date of the acquisition, a sale within a year or within a short period thereafter is probable. Disclosure of estimates When applying the accounting principles and rules for preparing the consolidated financial statements, management makes various judgments and estimates that may be vital to the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. If further explanation is necessary to provide the required insight in including the corresponding assumptions, is included in the notes to the relevant items of the consolidated financial statements. General accounting principles Accounting standards used to prepare the financial statements The consolidated financial statements are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of Title 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and with Dutch Accounting Standards applicable to micro and small entities, as issued by the Dutch Accounting Standard Board (Raad voor de Jaarverslaggeving). Assets and liabilities are generally valued at the cost of acquisition, production cost or at current value at the time of acquisition. If no specific valuation principle has been stated, valuation is at cost of acquisition. Policy of conversion of amounts denominated in foreign currency Items included in the financial statements of the company are valued with due regard for the currency in the economic environment in which the company carries out most of its activities (the functional currency). Exchange differences that arise from the settlement or translation of monetary items are recorded in the profit and loss account in the period in which they occur, unless hedge-accounting is applied. Transactions in foreign currency during the reporting period are recognized in the financial statements at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.\n",
      "Page 9: Page 9 Momo Medical Holding B.V., DELFT Policy of operating leases The company has lease contracts whereby a large part of the risks and rewards associated with ownership are not for the benefit of or incurred by the company. The lease contracts are recognised as operational leasing. Lease payments are recorded on a straight-line basis, taking into account reimbursements received from the lessor, in the profit and loss account for the duration of the contract. Accounting principles Policy of machinery Plant and equipment are valued at historical cost plus additional costs or production cost less straight-line depreciation based on the expected useful life and impairments expected. Subsidies on investments will be deducted from the historical cost price or production cost of the assets to which the subsidies relate. Policy of other property, plant and equipment Other tangible fixed assets are valued at cost of acquisition or production cost including directly attributable costs, less straight-line depreciation based on the estimated useful life and impairments. Policy of inventories Inventories (stocks) are valued at cost price based on the FIFO method or lower realisable value. The cost price consists of the cost of acquisition or production cost and costs incurred in order to bring the stocks to their current location and current condition. The production cost includes direct labour and fixed and variable production overheads, taking into account the costs of the operations office, the maintenance department and internal logistics. The realisable value is the estimated sales price less directly attributable sales costs. In determining the realisable value the obsolescence of the inventories is taken into account. Policy of receivables Receivables are initially valued at the fair value of the consideration to be received, including transaction costs if material. Receivables are subsequently valued at the amortised cost price. If there is no premium or discount and there are no transaction costs, the amortised cost price equals the nominal value of the accounts receivable. Provisions for bad debts are deducted from the carrying amount of the receivable. Policy of cash Cash at banks and in hand represent cash in hand, bank balances and deposits with terms of less than twelve months. Overdrafts at banks are recognised as part of debts to lending institutions under current liabilities. Cash at banks and in hand is valued at nominal value. Policy of group equity The accounting policies for equity are explained in more detail in the company financial statements. Policy of non-current liabilities\n",
      "Page 10: Page 10 Momo Medical Holding B.V., DELFT On initial recognition non-current liabilities are recognised at fair value. Transaction costs which can be directly attributed to the acquisition of the non-current liabilities are included in the initial recognition. After initial recognition non-current liabilities are recognised at the amortised cost, being the amount received taking into account premiums or discounts and minus transaction costs. If there is no premium / discount or if there are no transaction costs, the amortised cost is the same as the nominal value of the debt. The difference between stated book value and the mature redemption value is accounted for as interest cost in the profit and loss account on the basis of the effective interest rate during the estimated term of the non-current liabilities. Policy of current liabilities On initial recognition current liabilities are recognised at fair value. After initial recognition current liabilities are recognised at the amortised cost, being the amount received taking into account premiums or discounts and minus transaction costs. This is usually the nominal value. Accounting principles for determining the result The result is the difference between the realisable value of the goods/services provided and the costs and other charges during the year. The results on transactions are recognised in the year in which they are realised. Policy of net turnover Net turnover comprises the income from the supply of goods and services and realised income from construction contracts after deduction of discounts and such like and of taxes levied on the turnover. Revenues from the goods supplied are recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards in respect of the goods have been transferred to the buyer, the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, and it is probable that the revenue will be received. Revenue from services rendered are recognised if the result of a transaction relating to a service can be reliably estimated and the revenue is probable to be received. Revenues from the services rendered are recognised in proportion to the services delivered, based on the services rendered up to the balance sheet date in proportion to the total of services to be rendered. Policy of wages and salaries The benefits payable to personnel are recorded in the profit and loss account on the basis of the employment conditions. Policy of depreciation of property, plant and equipment Tangible fixed assets are depreciated from the date of initial use over the estimated useful economic life of the asset. Land and investment properties are not depreciated. Future depreciation is adjusted if there is a change in estimated future useful life. Gains and losses from the occasional sale of property, plant or equipment are included in depreciation. Policy of other operating expenses Costs are taken into account under the historical cost convention and allocated to the financial year concerned. Policy of financial income and expenses\n",
      "Page 11: Page 11 Momo Medical Holding B.V., DELFT Interest income and expenses are recognised on a pro rata basis, taking account of the effective interest rate of the assets and liabilities to which they relate. In accounting for interest expenses, the recognised transaction expenses for loans received are taken into consideration. Policy of income tax expense Tax on the result is calculated based on the result before tax in the profit and loss account, taking account of the losses available for set-off from previous financial years and exempt profit components and after the addition of non-deductible costs. The group as lessor Under operating leases, the lease income is recognized in the income statement straight line over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs are amortized over the term of the lease against the lease income.\n",

      "Page 19: Page 19 Momo Medical Holding B.V., DELFT Participations, over which significant influence can be exercised, are valued according to the net asset value method. In the event that 20% or more of the voting rights can be exercised, it may be assumed that there is significant influence. The net asset value is calculated in accordance with the accounting principles that apply for these financial statements; with regard to participations in which insufficient data is available for adopting these principles, the valuation principles of the respective participation are applied. If the valuation of a participation based on the net asset value is negative, it will be stated at nil. If and insofar as the company can be held fully or partially liable for the debts of the participation, or has the firm intention of enabling the participation to settle its debts, a provision is recognised for this. The provision is carried at the present value. If and to the extent the distribution of profits is subject to restrictions, these are included in a legal reserve. The group's share in direct equity increases and decreases of participating interests is also included in the legal reserve, except for asset revaluations recognized in the revaluation reserve. Newly acquired participations are initially recognised on the basis of the fair value of their identifiable assets and liabilities at the acquisition date. For subsequent valuations, the principles that apply for these financial statements are used, with the values upon their initial recognition as the basis. The amount by which the carrying amount of the participation has changed since the previous financial statements as a result of the net result achieved by the participation is recognised in the profit and loss account. Participations over which no significant influence can be exercised are valued at cost of acquisition. The result represents the dividend declared in the financial year, whereby dividend not distributed in cash is valued at fair value. In the event of an impairment loss, valuation takes place at the recoverable amount; an impairment is recognised and charged to the profit and loss account. Policy of share premium The share premium originates from overpayments on the nominal value of the shares. Policy of other reserves Other reserves are all reserves, except the legal and statutory reserves. Other reserves can freely be distributed to the shareholders.\n",
